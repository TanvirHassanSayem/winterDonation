# Winter Clothing Donation Website

## Project Overview
The Winter Clothing Donation website is a platform designed to connect donors with people in need across Bangladesh during the cold winter months. Our mission is to collect and distribute winter clothing to vulnerable communities, especially in rural and low-income areas where protection against cold weather is often inadequate.

## Purpose
When the weather gets colder, thousands of vulnerable people across Bangladesh struggle to stay warm because they don't have enough warm clothing. This web application serves as a bridge between those who want to help and those in need, making it easy for users to:

- Browse active donation campaigns
- Donate winter clothing items
- Track the impact of their contributions
- Learn about how the donation process works

Our platform focuses on making the donation process simple and transparent while creating a meaningful impact for communities in need.
